## Introduction

If you are a student completing this project as part of a class at Allegheny
College, please check the [Proactive Programmers Discord
server](https://discord.gg/kjah8MFYbR) for the assignment's due date. You can
learn more about this assignment by reading the [Structured
Types](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/data-abstraction/source-code-surveys/structured-types/)
project description on the [Proactive Programmers web
site](https://proactiveprogrammers.com). Please note that the content provided
in the README file for this GitHub repository is an overview of the project and
thus does not include the details concerning all the steps needed to
successfully complete the every project deliverable. Finally, it is important
to point out that your repository for this project was created from the GitHub
repository template called
[structured-types-starter](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/structured-types-solution).
You can check this repository for any updates to this project's documentation
or source code.

## Seeking Assistance

Even though the course instructor will have covered all of the concepts central
to this project before you start to work on it, please note that not every
detail needed to successfully complete the assignment will have been covered
during prior classroom sessions. This is by design as an important skill that
you must practice as a proactive programmer is to search for and then understand
and ultimately apply the technical content found in additional resources.

Emerging proactive programmers who have questions about this project are invited
to ask them in either the [GitHub discussions
forum](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/discussions)
or the [Proactive Programmers Discord server](https://discord.gg/kjah8MFYbR).
Before you ask your question, please read the advice concerning how to best
participate in the [Proactive Programmers
community](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/proactive-community/community-connections/).
If you find a mistake in this project, please describe it and propose a solution
by creating an issue in the [GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/issues).

## Project Overview

After cloning this repository to your computer, please take the following
steps:

- Make sure that you have already installed and know how to use all of the
  programming tools that are mentioned in the description of the [Proactive
  Skills](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/proactive-skills/technical-skills/introduction-technical-skills/).
- Follow the instructions on the Proactive Programmers web site for this project
  to take all of the needed steps and to complete all of the required
  deliverables.
- Use the `cd` command to change into the directory for this repository.
- Change into the program source code directory by typing `cd source`.
- Run both of the provided Python scripts by typing the following:
  - `python compute-tuple-intersection.py`: demonstrate computation of tuple intersection
  - `python perform-apply-to-each.py`: demonstrate the use of a higher-order function
- Confirm that the programs are producing the expected output.
- Make sure that you can explain why the programs produce the output that they do.
- If you have already installed the
  [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program that runs
  the automated grading checks provided by
  [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) you can, from the
  repository's base directory, run the automated grading checks by typing
  `gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`.
- You may also review the output from running GatorGrader in GitHub Actions.
- Don't forget to provide all of the required responses to the technical writing
  prompts in the `writing/reflection.md` file.
- Please make sure that you completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
  labels from all of the provided source code. This means that instead of only
  deleting the `TODO` marker from the code you should instead delete the `TODO`
  marker and the entire prompt and then add your own comments to demonstrate
  that you understand all of the source code in this project.
- Please make sure that you also completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
  labels from every line of the `writing/reflection.md` file. This means that
  you should not simply delete the `TODO` marker but instead delete the entire
  prompt so that your reflection is a document that contains polished technical
  writing that is suitable for publication on your professional web site.
